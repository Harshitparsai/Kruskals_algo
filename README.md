# Kruskals_algo
This is the fully discriptive code of the kruskals algorithm

Kruskals algorithm is used to find the no of the strongly connected component in the directed conneected graph

we first apply the DFS on the graph and stores the vertices in the stack on the basis of their finish time

then we reverse the vertices in the graph and the apply the DFS again on the non visited vertices
